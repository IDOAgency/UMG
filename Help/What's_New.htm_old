   Deadline Schedule Report</H3>
  <P>
   A new report has been added to Milestone that calculates future task 
   due dates based on the templates you select. This new report, the 
   Deadline Schedule Report, uses street dates, task owner and templates 
   as it's selection criteria. To run this report, enter a street date 
   range and select the templates for the report. The templates can be 
   selected by clicking on the template names. Use the Shift key to 
   select a series of templates that appear consecutively in the list, 
   or the Ctrl key to select templates when they do not appear 
   consecutively. The report will calculate the task due dates for each 
   street date listed. The street dates that appear will be based on the 
   selection criteria entered. For example, if your street date criteria 
   begin with 3/12/02, and end with 4/2/02, the report will calculate 
   the task due dates for the four street dates that fall within this 
   range. They will be displayed with one street date per column, 
   therefore you would see four columns, 3/12/02, 3/19/02, 3/26/02 and 
   4/2/02. </P>
