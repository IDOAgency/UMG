   Schedule</H1>
  <P>
   All tasks associated with manufacturing a release are assigned on the 
   Schedule screen. The Schedule screen is also used to directly update 
   task information on previously entered selections.</P>
  <P>
   When the Schedule screen is first opened, the listing on the 
   left-hand side of the screen will include selections for the company 
   under which the user operates. The schedule data form (right-hand 
   side of the screen) will either display information relative to the 
   highlighted record in the listing on the left, or it will display 
   information that pertains to the selection that was just created and saved.</P>
  <P>
   The top portion of the schedule section displays a subset of the data 
   entered in the Selection screen. The bottom section of the screen 
   displays either the tasks assigned to the selection or the options 
   available to assign tasks to a newly created selection.</P>
  <P>
   There are a couple of items to note with regard to the display of 
   tasks on the Schedule screen. Key tasks are displayed in a green font 
   to stand out from the others, label key tasks, appear in bold green. 
   Additionally, if a task is considered past due (no completion date or 
   the status does not indicate &quot;Done&quot;), the background color 
   of the Due Date field will turn pink. If the completion date is past 
   the due date, the background of the completion date field turns pink.</P>

   Between the Wks and Due columns is a thin column that will contain a

   The display of the Schedule screen can be changed to show only label 
   or UML tasks. To filter the schedule screen by label or UML tasks, 
   select the appropriate option from the filter drop-down list on the 
   Schedule screen.</P>
  <P>
   The three options are all tasks, only label tasks or only UML tasks.</P>
  <P>
   When the filter is applied to a schedule, only the tasks meeting the 
   criteria will appear.</P>
  <P>
   A default filter can be set-up for each user. The filter can also be 
   disabled for users so that the user would not have the ability to 
   change it.</P>
