- Find all places where queries are executed on vi_lookup_details,
  vi_lookup_header, vi_user, etc., and consider converting to cache
  lookups.  Example: TableManager.getTable() queries vi_lookup_details
  and two other queries.  Removing the vi_lookup_details query at
  least removes one.  The other two queries could be joined into one.

- All Managers that use Lookup_Details and Lookup_Subdetails should be
  getting lookup details and subdetails from the cache.  Okay, so this
  is repeated.

- Find all comments by me (search for capital BH) and see if I've left
  notes that you can address.

- Clean up all of the Manager's notepad lists to not use many repeated
  queries.  Issue a single query and build results from that.  Brett,
  is this done everywhere?

- Managers that affect cached details/subdetails should flush the 
  caches (or, better yet, the effected PORTION of the cache) on 
  update, new, and delete.  Sometimes, cached objects can be mutated
  in-place within the cache.

= JSP pages should use the Infrastructure reference for constructing 
  references to images, the servlet URL, etc.  The Infrastructure 
  reference is set up as "inf" by an include file that is included on
  all JSPs.  Mariana / Reena, is this done?

= JSP pages should include as few HTML comments as possible.  Move 
  most comments to Java comments.  M/R?

- JSP pages should never read request or session values.  When this
  happens, this indicates that the Handlers are not doing what they
  should be doing.  M/R?

= Try to move as much JavaScript to included .js files to reduce the
  load time of all pages.  M/R?

- All queries should have Strings properly escaped with a call to:
  MilestoneHelper.escapeSingleQuotes().  How is this going?

= Certify that -all- database connectors are properly closed by calling
  connector.close().  This is just an ongoing reminder.
  
- Let UMGIT know about the following changes:

  - We made a change to the stored procedure sp_sav_Template_Header, 
    adding "AS 'ReturnID'":
    original:
       SELECT @ReturnId 
       COMMIT TRAN
     
    changed to:
       SELECT @ReturnId AS 'ReturnID'
      COMMIT TRAN

  - Changed sp_sav_User (stored procedure)
    Included "AS 'ReturnID'" in order to set the proper user id of a 
    new user.

  - Added sp_get_audits to retreive audits for a specific "table" or
    "class" (the ID of which has to be from a row in the table named 
    AuditTable).

X All components should have a String COMPONENT_CODE that is exactly
  four letters long.
